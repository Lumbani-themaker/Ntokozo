<h2>What is a Boom Gate?</h2>
<p>A boom gate, also known as a barrier gate, is a security device typically used to control access to a restricted area. Boom gates are generally used at security checkpoints, parking garages, and other areas where it is important to control who has access. </p>
<p>The barrier gates typically consist of a barrier that is raised and lowered by either a remote control, a keypad, a proximity card, or a long-range RFID.</p>
<p>When the barrier is in the lowered position, it blocks access to the restricted area. When the barrier is in the raised position, it allows people to pass through.</p>

<h2>Where are Boom Gates Used?</h2>
<p>Boom gates are a type of barrier typically used to block access to a road or path. They are often seen at railway crossings, where they are used to block traffic while a train passes.</p>
<p>Boom gates can also be used to block access to checkpoints, parking facilities, and level crossings. Whatever their purpose, boom gates are an important part of keeping people safe and ensuring that traffic flows smoothly.</p>

<h2>Why You Need a Boom Gate for Your Premises</h2>
<p>A boom gate is an essential security measure for any commercial premises. By blocking vehicular access to a property, boom gates help to deter potential intruders and protect against unauthorized entry. </p>
<p>Also, barrier gates can be used to control the flow of pedestrian traffic, ensuring that only authorized personnel are able to enter a building. However, perhaps the most important function of a boom gate is that it provides a visual deterrent, making it clear that a property is well-protected.</p>

<h2>FAQ - Boom Gates</h2>

<h3>How do boom gates work?</h3>
<p>A boom gate is a type of barrier typically used to block access to a road, path, or car park. Most boom gates consist of two posts connected by a beam or bar. When the beam is in the horizontal position, it blocks the opening and prevents vehicles from passing. </p>
<p>Boom gates are usually operated by an electromechanical or hydraulic system that raises and lowers the beam in response to commands from an electronic controller. </p>
<p>In some cases, the controller may be activated by a button or lever; in others, it may be triggered automatically by sensors that detect the presence of a vehicle.</p>

<h3>What are boom gates made of?</h3>
<p>Boom gates can be made from a variety of materials, but most are made from steel or aluminium.</p>
<p>Boom gates are made up of a number of different parts that work together to control the flow of traffic. The main component is the boom, which is a large arm that is raised and lowered to block or allow access to roads or carriageways. The boom is connected to a pivot point, which allows it to move up and down. </p>
<p>A counterweight is also attached to the boom, which helps to balance it and make it easier to operate. When the boom is in the lowered position, a set of red and white flashing lights are activated to warn drivers of the obstruction.</p>

<h3>How many types of boom gate are there?</h3>
<p>There are two main types of boom gate: manual and automatic. Manual gates are the simplest and most common type, operated by a handle or lever. Automatic gates are either motor-driven or hydraulically operated, and may be triggered by a variety of devices including induction loops, barriers, or remote controls. </p>

<h3>How much does a boom gate cost?</h3>
<p>A simple boom gate install can cost anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 depending on the type of access control required. More sophisticated installations which include payment systems and LPR cameras range in price and require expert advice.</p>
